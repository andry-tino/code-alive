# Example: Camera auto fitting
This example is intended to show how to move the camera and change it settings to fit the scene as more objects populate the scene.

## Requirements
- Must use Unity.
- One camera.
- Change camera to fit scene content everytime the scene changes.

Extra:
- Move the camera so that it is in a final position such that the component which was added last is the first in view.
